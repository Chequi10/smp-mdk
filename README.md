SmpMdk
======

Forked from [Burak Deniz's implementation of SMP](https://github.com/GITburakdeniz/smp-mdk) for open-source development of SMP models, mainly geared for academic research projects including HIL (Hardware in the Loop), and OBC (On board computer) device and peripheral models.

Differences from original author's code:

- Migrating to CMake build system [WIP].
- Adding examples from the handbook [WIP].
